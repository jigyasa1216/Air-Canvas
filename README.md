## Inspiration
**Air Canvas** is a contribution to the education industry also making an impact on reduce, recuse and recycle chain by introducing a method of teaching which just requires a teacher to teach. No more use of plastic made markers or environment harming chalks. You got everything at your fingertips!  

## What it does
It uses the techniques of OpenCV and detects your finger points making a sketch following your fingers. You can draw anything in the air in the allotted space and can choose the pen of any color you want to highlight certain information.

## How I built it
It is purely based on python programming due to its exhaustive programming. Here Color Detection and tracking are used in order to achieve the objective. The color marker is detected and a mask is produced. It includes the further steps of morphological operations on the mask produced which are Erosion and Dilation. Erosion reduces the impurities present in the mask and dilation further restores the eroded main mask.

## Challenges I ran into
It was really challenging to make the boundaries and coordinates accurate enough so that the user and the audience could draw and see everything clearly and accurately.
 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am very proud of its smooth working and the output it gives. The time limit in which I created it as an individual too makes me wanting to give a pat in my back!

## What I learned
I learnt abut various python libraries, their exhaustive uses and programming but most importantly it has to be the time management and self confidence for me which helped me build this project.
